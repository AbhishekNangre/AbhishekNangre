Hello 
I’m still a student, still learning, and still messing with code to see what works (and what doesn’t). I talk to my computer more than to humans — sadly it mostly replies with errors.

I make code, games, and write stuff sometimes.
Half my projects are still on my laptop because I forgot to upload them,
and the rest are half-finished and waiting for “future me” to fix them (good luck, future me).

- Most nights I’m either:

- fixing bugs I created,

- reading comics/novels,

- or getting destroyed in boss fights.

And yes… I once made a bird that refuses to fly properly.
It’s still out there, disappointing me one frame at a time.
