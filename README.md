I talk to my computer more than to humans—unfortunately, it talks back only in errors.  
Code, novels, and games—that’s pretty much me.
Some nights I’m fixing bugs, other nights I’m reading or getting destroyed in boss fights. Sometimes, I even make the games.
Oh and yes… I made a bird that refuses to fly properly :(
