I’m still a student, still learning, and still messing with code to see if things work (mostly, they don't).

I write code, make games, and write stuff sometimes.  
Half my projects are still on my laptop because I forgot to upload them, and the rest are half-finished and waiting for "future me" to fix them (good luck, future me).

And yes… I once made a bird that refuses to fly properly. It’s still out there, disappointing me one frame at a time.
